# Changes by version number

### 0.10.1

Changes

- Show advantage and disadvantage for rolled saves

Fixes

- Fixed a v10 update regression that prevented spell slots from being used when spells were cast. Oops.
- Changed the "A creature first enters the area on its turn" condition to be "A creature first enters the area on a turn", more in line with the rules
- Using WIRE without DAE no longer starts with an error
- The GM rolling with public rolls caused erroneous results. Public GM rolls should now work better.
